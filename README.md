# gpio-input-handler

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mwittig/gpio-input-handler.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This code has been written as part of an prototyping activity in about two days. It is a simple 
application to report activities on observed GPIO input ports. In the given example, a 
fictitious REST IOT service is invoked which consists of two consecutively called operations.

As part of the prototype the code has been used to monitor reed contacts. A fritzing sketch and
the BOM are included in the hardware directory.
